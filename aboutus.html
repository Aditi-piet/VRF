         <h1> ABOUT US </h1>


          <br><h3>WHO WE ARE</h3></br>
          <h4>  <p style="color:white"> VRF is an innovative global healthcare company, driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

          Our teams across the world strive to transform the practice of medicine, turning the impossible into the possible for patients.

          We provide potentially life-changing treatments and the protection of life-saving vaccines to millions of people, and affordable access to our medicines in some of the world’s poorest countries.
          When properly stimulated, the human immune system is incredibly powerful and has profound potential. Because of their structural similarity to viruses presented in nature, virus-like particles (VLPs) are ideal for stimulating potent immune responses. Most of the emerging and re-emerging viruses that pose significant health threats are enveloped viruses, making them a prime target for VBI’s proprietary enveloped virus-like particle (eVLP) platform technology.
        </h4>   </p>
            <br><h3> COMMITMENT TO QUALITY </h3></br>
            <h4>  <p> VRF's quality control laboratories are equipped with a wide array of sophisticated analytical equipment such as HPLC with PDA detector, Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectrophotometer, Gas Chromatograph, Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, real-time PCR, new Dionex, Karl Fischer Moisture Analyzer, ELISA Readers, Liquid Particle Counters, Capillary Zone Electrophoresis, Bio-Plex and several other state-of-the-art instruments. The technical team has developed systems to ensure that quality is built into the process, leading to consistency of output.
           </h4> </P>
        <br><h3>IMMUNIZATION</h3></br>
        <h4><p> Immunization is the safest and most effective way of giving protection against vaccine preventable disease. After immunization, your child is far less likely to catch the disease if there are cases in the community. The benefit of protection against the disease far outweighs the time and money spent on curing the disease.

    If all people in the community are immunized, the infection can no longer be spread from person to person and the disease is wiped out from the community. This is how smallpox was eliminated from the world, and polio has disappeared from many countries. India was declared Polio free on 27th March, 2014

    Routine Immunization (RI) is a strategic investment for a healthier nation. India’s routine immunization program is dynamic and over the years has evolved to address the changing public health needs of the country.

    Tremendous gains have been made in immunization coverage in a country where challenges reflect accessibility, acceptability and availability issues. Assam is one of the best performing states in the country with>91% full immunization status.
